#Argentina
On the occasion of its accession to the Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness, adopted in New York on 30 August 1961, the Republic of Argentina objects and rejects the attempt to extend the territorial application of this instrument to the Malvinas Islands made by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland upon ratification.The Argentine Government recalls that the Malvinas Islands, South Georgia Islands and South Sandwich Islands and the surrounding maritime areas are an integral part of the Argentine national territory and, being illegally occupied by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, are the subject of a sovereignty dispute between the two countries which is recognized by several international organizations.In this connection, the General Assembly of the United Nations has adopted resolutions 2065 (XX), 3160 (XXVIII), 31/49, 37/9, 38/12, 39/6, 40/21, 41/40, 42/19 and 43/25, in which the sovereignty dispute referred to as the “Question of the Malvinas Islands” is recognized and the Governments of the Argentine Republic and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland are urged to resume negotiations in order to find as soon as possible a peaceful and lasting solution to the dispute. Concurrently, the Special Committee on Decolonization of the United Nations has repeatedly affirmed this view, most recently in its resolution adopted on 26 June 2014. Also, the General Assembly of the Organization of American States adopted, on 5 June 2014, a new pronouncement, in similar terms, on the question.The Argentine Government reaffirms its legitimate sovereign rights over the Malvinas Islands, South Georgia Islands and South Sandwich Islands and the surrounding maritime areas, as well asover the Argentine Antarctic Sector.
