Matters for which the Community has exclusive competence1. Member States have transferred competence to the Community with regard to the conservation and management of living marine resources. Hence, in this field, it is for the Community to adopt the relevant rules and regulations (which the Member States enforce) and within its competence to enter into external undertakings with third States or competent organisations. This competence applies in regard of waters under national fisheries jurisdiction and to the high seas.2. The Community enjoys the regulatory competence granted under international law to the flag State of a vessel to determine the conservation and management measures for marine fisheries resources applicable to vessels flying the flag of Member States and to ensure that Member States adopt provisions allowing for the implementation of the said measures.3. Nevertheless, measures applicable in respect of masters and other officers of fishing vessels, for example refusal, withdrawal or suspension of authorisations to serve as such, are within the competence of the Member States in accordance with their national legislation. Measures relating to the exercise of jurisdiction by the flag State over its vessels on the high seas, in particular provisions such as those related to the taking and relinquishing of control of fishing vessels by States other than the flag State, international cooperation in respect of enforcement and the recovery of the control of their vessels, are within the competence of the Member States in compliance with Community law.II. Matters for which both the Community and its Member States have competence4. The Community shares competence with its Member States on the following matters governed by this Agreement: requirements of developing States, scientific research, port-State measures and measures adopted in respect of non-members of regional fisheries organisations and non-Parties to the Agreement. The following provisions of the Agreement apply both to the Community and to its Member States:- general provisions: (articles 1, 4, and 34 to 50)- dispute settlement: (Part VIII)."Interpretative Declarations by the Republic of Austria with regard to the Agreement on the implementation of the provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 relating to the conservation and management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks1. The Republic of Austria understands that the terms ‘geographical particularities', ‘specific characteristics of the sub-region or region', ‘socioeconomic geographical and environment factors', ‘natural characteristics of that sea' or any other similar terms employed in reference to a geographical region do not prejudice the rights and duties of States under international law.2. The Republic of Austria understands that no provision of this Agreement may be interpreted in such a way as to conflict with the principle of freedom of the high seas, recognised by international law.3. The Republic of Austria understands that the term ‘States whose nationals fish on the highll not provide any new grounds for jurisdiction based on the nationality of persons involved in fishing on the high seas rather than on the principle of flag State jurisdiction.4. The Agreement does not grant any State the right to maintain or apply unilateral measures during the transitional period as referred to in article 21 (3). Thereafter, if no agreement has been reached, States shall act only in accordance with the provisions provided for in articles 21 and 22 of the Agreement.5. Regarding the application of article 21, the Republic of Austria understands that, when a flag State declares that it intends to exercise its authority, in accordance with the provisions in article 19, over a fishing vessel flying its flag, the authorities of the inspecting State shall not purport to exercise any further authority under the provisions of article 21 over such a vessel. Any dispute related to this issue shall be settled in accordance with the procedures provided for in Part VIII of the Agreement. No State may invoke this type of dispute to remain in control of a vessel which does not fly its flag. In addition, the Republic of Austria considers that the word ‘unlawful' in article 21 (18) of the Agreement should be interpreted in the light of the whole Agreement, and in particular, articles 4 and 35 thereof.6. The Republic of Austria reiterates that all States shall refrain in their relations from the threat or use of force in accordance with general principles of international law, the United Nations Charter and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. In addition, the Republic of Austria underlines that the use of force as referred to in article 22 constitutes an exceptional measure which must be based on the strictest compliance with the principle of proportionality and that any abuse thereof shall imply the international liability of the inspecting State. Any case of non-compliance shall be resolved by peaceful means and in accordance wi the applicable dispute-settlement procedures. Furthermore, the Republic of Austria considers that the relevant terms and conditions for boarding and inspection should be further elaborated in accordance with the relevant principles of international law in the framework of the appropriate regional and subregional fisheries management organisations and arrangements.7. The Republic of Austria understands that in the application of the provisions of article 21 (6), (7) and (8), the flag State may rely on the requirements of its legal system under which the prosecuting authorities enjoy a discretion to decide whether or not to prosecute in the light of all the facts of a case. Decisions of the flag State based on such requirements shall not be interpreted as failure to respond or to take action."Confirmation by the Republic of Austria of the declarations made by the European Community upon ratification of the Agreement for the implementing of the provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 relating to the conservation and management of straddling fish stocksThe Republic of Austria hereby confirms the declarations made by the European Community upon ratification of the Agreement for the implementing of the provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 relating to the conservation and management of straddling fish stocks,... :"See declarations under “European Community”.

Statement:"It is the belief of the Government of the People's Republic of China that the said Agreement is an important development of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. This Agreement will have a significant impact on the conservation and management of living marine resources, especially fish resources in the high seas as well as on the international cooperation in fishery. Upon signing the Agreement, the Government of the People's Republic of China wish to make the following statement in accordance with article 43 of the Agreement:1.About the understanding of paragraph 7 of article 21 of the Agreement: The Government of China is of the view that the enforcement action taken by the inspecting State with the authorization of the flag State involves state sovereignty and national legislation of the States concerned. The authorized enforcement action should be limited to the mode and scope as specified in the authorization by the flag State. Enforcement action by the inspecting State under such circumstances should only be that of executing the authorization of the flag state.2.About the understanding of subparagraph (f), paragraph 1 of article 22 of the Agreement: This subparagraph provides that the inspecting State shall ensure that its duly authorized inspectors `avoid the use of force except when and to the degree necessary to ensure the safety of the inspectors and where the inspectors are obstructed in the execution of their duties. The degree of force used shall not exceed that reasonably required in the circumstances'. The understanding of the Chinese Government on this provision is that only when the personal safety of the authorized inspectors whose authorization has been duly verified is endangered and their normal inspecting activities are obstructed by violence committed by crew members of fishermen of the fishing vessel under inspection, may the inspectors take appropriate compulsory measures necessary to stop such violence. It should be emphasized that the action of force by the inspectors shall only be taken against those crew members or fishermen committing the violence and must never be taken against the vessel as a whole or other crew members or fishermen."

"... in terms of article 43 of the Agreement, the Government of Malta, enters the following declaration:1. In the view of the Malta Government, the requirements of implementing the 1995 Agreement must be in conformity with the 1982 Convention on the Law of the Sea.2. Malta understands that the terms "geographical particularities", specific characteristics of the sub-region", "socio-economic geographical and environmental factors", "natural characteristics of that sea" or any other similar terms employed in reference to a geographical region do not prejudice the rights and duties of States under international law.3. Malta understands that no Provision of this Agreement may be interpreted in such a way as to conflict with the principle of freedom of the high seas, and of flag state exclusive jurisdiction over its vessels on the high seas as recognised by international law.4. Malta understands that the term "States whose nationals fish on the high seas" shall not provide any new grounds for jurisdiction based on the nationality of persons involved in fishing on the high seas rather than on the principle of flag State jurisdiction.5. The Agreement does not grant any State the right to maintain or apply unilateral measures during the transitional period as referred to in article 21 (3). Thereafter, if no agreement has been reached, States shall act only in accordance with the provisions provided for in articles 21 and 22 of the Agreement.6. Regarding the application of article 21, Malta understands that, when a flag State declares that it intends to exercise its authority, in accordance with the provisions in article 19, over a fishing vessel flying its flag, the authorities of the inspecting State shall not purport to exercise any other authority under the provisions of article 21 over such vessel.Any dispute related to this issue shall be settled in accordance with the procedures provided for in Part VIII of the Agreement. No State may invoke this type of dispute to remain in control of a vessel, which does not fly its flag.In addition, Malta considers that the word "unlawful" in article 21, para. 18 of the Agreement should be interpreted in the light of the whole Agreement, and in particular, articles 4 and 35 thereof.7. Malta reiterates that all States shall refrain in their relations from the threat or use of force in accordance with general principles of international law, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.Furthermore, Malta considers that the relevant terms and conditions for boarding and inspection should be further elaborated in accordance with the relevant principles of international law in the framework of the appropriate regional and sub-regional fisheries management organisations and arrangements.8. Malta understands that in the application of the provisions of article 21 paragraphs 6, 7 and 8, the flag State may rely on the requirements of its legal system under which the prosecuting authorities enjoy a discretion to decide whether or not to prosecute in the light of all the facts of a case. Decisions of the flag State based on such requirements shall not be interpreted as failure to respond or to take action.9. Malta hereby declares that the provisions of article 21 and 22 apply only to maritime fishing.10. These provisions cannot be regarded as capable of being extended to cover vessels engaged in maritime transport under another international instrument, or of being transferred to any instrument not dealing directly with the conservation and management of fisheries resources covered by the Agreement.11. The Agreement does not grant any State the right to maintain or apply unilateral measures during the transitional period as referred to in article 21 (3). Thereafter, if no agreement has been reached, States shall act only in accordance with the provisions provided for in article 21 and 22 of the Agreement.12.Malta does not consider itself bound by any of the declarations which other States may have made, or will make, upon signing or ratifying the Agreement, reserving the right, as necessary, to determine its position with regard to each of them at the appropriate time, in particular, ratification of the Agreement does not imply automatic recognition of maritime or territorial claims by any signatory or ratifying State.13. Note is taken of the statement by the European Community made at the time of signature of the Agreement regarding the fact that its Member States have transferred competence to it with regard to certain aspects of the Agreement. In view of Malta's application to join the European Community, it is understood that this will also become applicable to Malta on membership.Furthermore, the Government of Malta would like to state that should Malta accede to the European Union, it reserves the right to submit a further Declaration in line with future declarations by the European Union."

Declaration:Spain, as a member of the European Community, points out that it has transferred competence to the Community with regard to a number of matters regulated by the Fish Stocks Convention. Spain hereby reaffirms the declarations made by the European Community upon ratifying the Agreement for the Implementation of the Provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 relating to the Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks.See declarations under “European Community”.Interpretative declarations:1.Spain understand that the terms "geographical particularities", "specific characteristics of the subregion or region", "socio-economic, geographical and environmental factors", "natural characteristics of that sea" or any other similar terms employed in reference to a geographical region do not prejudice the rights and duties of States under international law.2.Spain understands that no provision of this Agreement may be interpreted in such a way as to conflict with the principle of freedom of the high seas, recognized by international law.3.Spain understand that the term "States whose nationals fish on the high seas" shall not provide any new grounds for jurisdiction based on the nationality of persons involved in fishing on the high seas rather than on the principle of flag State jurisdiction.4.The Agreement does not grant any State the right to maintain or apply unilateral measures during the transitional period as referred to in article 21, paragraph 3. Thereafter, if no agreement has been reached, States shall act only in accordance with the provisions provided for in articles 21 and 22 of the Agreement.5.Regarding the application ofarticle 21, Spain understands that, when a flag State declares that it intends to exercise its authority, in accordance with the provisions of article 19, over a fishing vessel flying its flag, the auities of the inspecting State shall not purport to exercise any further authority under the provisions of article 21 over such a vessel.Any dispute related to this issue shall be settled in accordance with the procedures provided for in part VIII of the Agreement.

Decisions of the flag State based on such requirements shall not be interpreted as failure to respond or to take action.8.Spain is of the view that the constituent conventions of regional fisheries management organizations such as the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization, the North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission and the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas, given their status as special international agreements, have legal precedence over the New York Agreement, which sets forth general rules on the conservation and management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks. Part VI of the Agreement, "Compliance and enforcement", laying down boarding and inspection procedures, is therefore to be regarded as a regulation subordinate to alternative mechanisms established by subregional or regional fisheries management organizations which effectively discharge the obligations under the New York Agreement of their members or participants to ensure compliance with the conservation and management measures established by such organizations or arrangements.9.Spain understands that in article 8, paragraph 3, of the Agreement the term "a real interest" used with reference to States which may be members of a regional fisheries management organization shall be regarded as meaning that a regional fisheries management organization must in all circumstances be open to any State whose fleet fishes or has fished in the area covered by the constituent convention of such organization, in respect of which fleet the flag State has the authority to ensure compliance and enforcement. Participation in such organizations by the States in question shall indicate their real interest in the fisheries.

uruguay
1.The objective of the Agreement, as set out in article 2, is to establish an appropriate legal framework and a comprehensive and effective set of measures for the conservation and management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks.2.The effectiveness of the regime established will depend, inter alia , on whether the conservation and management measures that are applied in areas beyond national jurisdiction take duly into account and are compatible with, those adopted by the relevant coastal States with respect to the same stocks in areas under their national jurisdiction, as provided for in article 7.3.Among the biological characteristics of a fish stock as a factor of which special account must be taken in determining compatible conservation and management measures, in accordance with article 7, paragraph 2(d), Uruguay attaches particular importance to the reproduction period of the fish stock in question, in order to ensure a sound and balanced approach to protection.4.Moreover, in order for the above-mentioned regime to be fully effective, in accordance with the objective and purpose of the Agreement, it is necessary to adopt emergency conservation and management measures, as stated in article 6, paragraph 7, where a serious threat exists to the survival of one or more straddling fish stocks or highly migratory fish stocks as a result of a natural phenomenon or human activity.5.Uruguay is of the view that, if an inspection carried out by a port State on a fishing vessel which is voluntarily present in one of its ports reveals that there are evident grounds for believing that the said fishing vessel has been involved in an activity that is contrary to the sub-regional or regional conservation and management measures on the high seas, then, in exercise of its right and duty to cooperate in conformity with article 23 of the Agreement, the port State should so inform the flag State and request that it take over responsibility for the vessel for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the said measures.

Statement:"It is the belief of the Government of the People's Republic of China that the said Agreement is an important development of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.

Enforcement action by the inspecting State under such circumstances should only be that of executing the authorization of the flag state.2.About the understanding of subparagraph (f), paragraph 1 of article 22 of the Agreement: This subparagraph provides that the inspecting State shall ensure that its duly authorized inspectors `avoid the use of force except when and to the degree necessary to ensure the safety of the inspectors and where the inspectors are obstructed in the execution of their duties. The degree of force used shall not exceed that reasonably required in the circumstances'. The understanding of the Chinese Government on this provision is that only when the personal safety of the authorized inspectors whose authorization has been duly verified is endangered and their normal inspecting activities are obstructed by violence committed by crew members of fishermen of the fishing vessel under inspection, may the inspectors take appropriate compulsory measures necessary to stop such violence. It should be emphasized that the action of force by the inspectors shall only be taken against those crew members or fishermen committing the violence and must never be taken against the vessel as a whole or other crew members or fishermen."

“DeclarationThe Republic of Slovenia declares upon the deposit of the Instrument of Accession of the Agreement on the implementation of the provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 relating to the conservation and management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks that she has, as a Member State of the European Community, transferred competence to the Community in respect of the following matters governed by the Agreement:I.Matters for which the Community has exclusive competence1.Member States have transferred competence to the Community with regard to the conservation and management of living marine resources. Hence, in this field, it is for the Community to adopt the relevant rules and regulations (which the Member States enforce) and within its competence to enter into external undertakings with third States or competent organisations. This competence applies in regard of waters under national fisheries jurisdiction and to the high seas.2.The Community enjoys the regulatory competence granted under international law to the flag State of a vessel to determine the conservation and management measures for marine fisheries resources applicable to vessels flying the flag of Member States and to ensure that Member States adopt provisions allowing for the implementation of the said measures.3.Nevertheless, measures applicable in respect of masters and other officers of fishing vessels, for example refusal, withdrawal or suspension of authorisations to serve as such, are within the competence of the Member States in accordance with their national legislation.Measures relating to the exercise of jurisdiction by the flag State over its vessels on the high seas, in particular provisions such as those related to the taking and relinquishing of control of fishing vessels by States other than the flag State, international cooperation in respect of enforment and the recovery of the control of their vessels, are within the competence of the Member States in compliance with Community law.II.Matters for which both the Community and its Member States have competenceThe Community shares competence with its Member States on the following matters governed by this Agreement: requirements of developing States, scientific research, port-State measures and measures adopted in respect of non-members of regional fisheries organisations and non-Parties to the Agreement. The following provisions of the Agreement apply both to the Community and to its Member States:-general provisions: (Articles 1, 4, and 34 to 50)- dispute settlement: (Part VIII).Interpretative Declaration1.The Republic of Slovenia understands that the terms 'geographical particularities', 'specific characteristics of the sub-region or region', 'socioeconomic geographical and environment factors', 'natural characteristics of that sea' or any other similar terms employed in reference to a geographical region do not prejudice the rights and duties of States under international law.2.The Republic of Slovenia understands that no provision of this Agreement may be interpreted in such a way as to conflict with the principle of freedom of the high seas, recognised by international law.3.The Republic of Slovenia understands that the term 'States whose nationals fish on the high seas' shall not provide any new grounds for jurisdiction based on the nationality of persons involved in fishing on the high seas rather than on the principle of flag State jurisdiction.4.The Agreement does not grant any State the right to maintain or apply unilateral measures during the transitional period as referred to in Article 21 (3). Thereafter, if no agreement has been reached, States shall act only in accordance with the provisions provided for in Articles 21 and 22 of the Agreement.5.Regarding the application of Article 21, the Republic of Slovenia understands that, when a flag State declares that it intends to exercise its authority, in accordance with the provisions in Article 19, over a fishing vessel flying its flag, the authorities of the inspecting State shall not purport to exercise any further authority under the provisions of Article 21 over such a vessel. Any dispute related to this issue shall be settled in accordance with the procedures provided for in Part VIII of the Agreement. No State may invoke this type of dispute to remain in control of a vessel which does not fly its flag. In addition, the Republic of Slovenia considers that the word 'unlawful' in Article 21 (18) of the Agreement should be interpreted in the light of the whole Agreement, and in particular, Articles 4 and 35 thereof.6.The Republic of Slovenia reiterates that all States shall refrain in their relations from the threat or use of force in accordance with general principles of international law, the United Nations Charter and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. In addition, the Republic of Slovenia underlines that the use of force as referred to in Article 22 constitutes an exceptional measure which must be based on the strictest compliance with the principle of proportionality and that any abuse thereof shall imply the international liability of the inspecting State. Any case of non-compliance shall be resolved by peaceful means and in accordance with the applicable dispute-settlement procedures. Furthermore, the Republic of Slovenia considers that the relevant terms and conditions for boarding and inspection should be further elaborated in accordance with the relevant principles of international law in the framework of the appropriate regional and subregional fisheries management organisations and arrangements.7.The Republic of Slovenia understands that in the application of the provisions of Article 21 (6), (7) and (8), the flag State may rely on the requirements of its legal system under which the prosecuting authorities enjoy a discretion to decide whether or not to prosecute in the light of all the facts of a case. Decisions of the flag State based on such requirements shall not be interpreted as failure to respond or to take action."Confirmation of the declarations made by the European CommunityThe Republic of Slovenia hereby confirms the declarations made by the European Community upon ratification of the Agreement for the implementing of the provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 relating to the conservation and management of straddling fish stocks.”

Declaration:Spain, as a member of the European Community, points out that it has transferred competence to the Community with regard to a number of matters regulated by the Fish Stocks Convention. Spain hereby reaffirms the declarations made by the European Community upon ratifying the Agreement for the Implementation of the Provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 relating to the Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks.See declarations under “European Community”.Interpretative declarations:1.Spain understand that the terms "geographical particularities", "specific characteristics of the subregion or region", "socio-economic, geographical and environmental factors", "natural characteristics of that sea" or any other similar terms employed in reference to a geographical region do not prejudice the rights and duties of States under international law.2.Spain understands that no provision of this Agreement may be interpreted in such a way as to conflict with the principle of freedom of the high seas, recognized by international law.3.Spain understand that the term "States whose nationals fish on the high seas" shall not provide any new grounds for jurisdiction based on the nationality of persons involved in fishing on the high seas rather than on the principle of flag State jurisdiction.4.The Agreement does not grant any State the right to maintain or apply unilateral measures during the transitional period as referred to in article 21, paragraph 3. Thereafter, if no agreement has been reached, States shall act only in accordance with the provisions provided for in articles 21 and 22 of the Agreement.5.Regarding the application ofarticle 21, Spain understands that, when a flag State declares that it intends to exercise its authority, in accordance with the provisions of article 19, over a fishing vessel flying its flag, the auities of the inspecting State shall not purport to exercise any further authority under the provisions of article 21 over such a vessel.Any dispute related to this issue shall be settled in accordance with the procedures provided for in part VIII of the Agreement. No State may invoke this type of dispute to remain in control of a vessel which does not fly its flag.In addition, Spain considers that the word "unlawful" in article 21, paragraph 18 of the Agreement should be interpreted in the light of the whole Agreement, particularly, articles 4 and 35 thereof.6.Spain reiterates that all States shall refrain in their relations from the threat or use of force in accordance with general principles of international law, the United Nations Charter and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.In addition, Spain underlines that the use of force as referred to in article 22 constitutes an exceptional measure which must be based upon the strictest compliance with the principle of proportionality and that any abuse thereof shall imply the international liability of the inspecting State. Any case of non-compliance shall be resolved by peaceful means and in accordance with the applicable dispute-settlement procedures.Furthermore, Spain considers that the relevant terms and conditions for boarding and inspection should be further elaborated in accordance with the relevant principles of international law in the framework of the appropriate regional and subregional fisheries management organizations and arrangements.7.Spain understand that in the application of the provisions of article 21, paragraphs 6, 7 and 8, the flag State may rely on the requirements of its legal system under which the prosecuting authorities enjoy a discretion to decide whether or not to prosecute in the light of all the facts of a case. Decisions of the flag State based on such requirements shall not be interpreted as failure to respond or to take action.8.Spain is of the view that the constituent conventions of regional fisheries management organizations such as the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization, the North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission and the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas, given their status as special international agreements, have legal precedence over the New York Agreement, which sets forth general rules on the conservation and management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks. Part VI of the Agreement, "Compliance and enforcement", laying down boarding and inspection procedures, is therefore to be regarded as a regulation subordinate to alternative mechanisms established by subregional or regional fisheries management organizations which effectively discharge the obligations under the New York Agreement of their members or participants to ensure compliance with the conservation and management measures established by such organizations or arrangements.9.Spain understands that in article 8, paragraph 3, of the Agreement the term "a real interest" used with reference to States which may be members of a regional fisheries management organization shall be regarded as meaning that a regional fisheries management organization must in all circumstances be open to any State whose fleet fishes or has fished in the area covered by the constituent convention of such organization, in respect of which fleet the flag State has the authority to ensure compliance and enforcement. Participation in such organizations by the States in question shall indicate their real interest in the fisheries.

1.The objective of the Agreement, as set out in article 2, is to establish an appropriate legal framework and a comprehensive and effective set of measures for the conservation and management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks.2.The effectiveness of the regime established will depend, inter alia , on whether the conservation and management measures that are applied in areas beyond national jurisdiction take duly into account and are compatible with, those adopted by the relevant coastal States with respect to the same stocks in areas under their national jurisdiction, as provided for in article 7.3.Among the biological characteristics of a fish stock as a factor of which special account must be taken in determining compatible conservation and management measures, in accordance with article 7, paragraph 2(d), Uruguay attaches particular importance to the reproduction period of the fish stock in question, in order to ensure a sound and balanced approach to protection.4.Moreover, in order for the above-mentioned regime to be fully effective, in accordance with the objective and purpose of the Agreement, it is necessary to adopt emergency conservation and management measures, as stated in article 6, paragraph 7, where a serious threat exists to the survival of one or more straddling fish stocks or highly migratory fish stocks as a result of a natural phenomenon or human activity.5.Uruguay is of the view that, if an inspection carried out by a port State on a fishing vessel which is voluntarily present in one of its ports reveals that there are evident grounds for believing that the said fishing vessel has been involved in an activity that is contrary to the sub-regional or regional conservation and management measures on the high seas, then, in exercise of its right and duty to cooperate in conformity with article 23 of the Agreement, the port State should so inform the flag State and request that it take over responsibility for the vessel for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the said measures.

Statement:"It is the belief of the Government of the People's Republic of China that the said Agreement is an important development of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. This Agreement will have a significant impact on the conservation and management of living marine resources, especially fish resources in the high seas as well as on the international cooperation in fishery. Upon signing the Agreement, the Government of the People's Republic of China wish to make the following statement in accordance with article 43 of the Agreement:1.About the understanding of paragraph 7 of article 21 of the Agreement: The Government of China is of the view that the enforcement action taken by the inspecting State with the authorization of the flag State involves state sovereignty and national legislation of the States concerned. The authorized enforcement action should be limited to the mode and scope as specified in the authorization by the flag State. Enforcement action by the inspecting State under such circumstances should only be that of executing the authorization of the flag state.2.About the understanding of subparagraph (f), paragraph 1 of article 22 of the Agreement: This subparagraph provides that the inspecting State shall ensure that its duly authorized inspectors `avoid the use of force except when and to the degree necessary to ensure the safety of the inspectors and where the inspectors are obstructed in the execution of their duties. The degree of force used shall not exceed that reasonably required in the circumstances'. The understanding of the Chinese Government on this provision is that only when the personal safety of the authorized inspectors whose authorization has been duly verified is endangered and their normal inspecting activities are obstructed by violence committed by crew members of fishermen of the fishing vessel under inspection, may the inspectors take appropriate compulsory measures necessary to stop such violence. It should be emphasized that the action of force by the inspectors shall only be taken against those crew members or fishermen committing the violence and must never be taken against the vessel as a whole or other crew members or fishermen."

Thereafter, if no agreement has been reached, States shall act only in accordance with the provisions provided for in Articles 21 and 22 of the Agreement.5.Regarding the application of Article 21, the Republic of Slovenia understands that, when a flag State declares that it intends to exercise its authority, in accordance with the provisions in Article 19, over a fishing vessel flying its flag, the authorities of the inspecting State shall not purport to exercise any further authority under the provisions of Article 21 over such a vessel. Any dispute related to this issue shall be settled in accordance with the procedures provided for in Part VIII of the Agreement. No State may invoke this type of dispute to remain in control of a vessel which does not fly its flag. In addition, the Republic of Slovenia considers that the word 'unlawful' in Article 21 (18) of the Agreement should be interpreted in the light of the whole Agreement, and in particular, Articles 4 and 35 thereof.6.The Republic of Slovenia reiterates that all States shall refrain in their relations from the threat or use of force in accordance with general principles of international law, the United Nations Charter and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. In addition, the Republic of Slovenia underlines that the use of force as referred to in Article 22 constitutes an exceptional measure which must be based on the strictest compliance with the principle of proportionality and that any abuse thereof shall imply the international liability of the inspecting State. Any case of non-compliance shall be resolved by peaceful means and in accordance with the applicable dispute-settlement procedures. Furthermore, the Republic of Slovenia considers that the relevant terms and conditions for boarding and inspection should be further elaborated in accordance with the relevant principles of international law in the framework of the appropriate regional and subregional fisheries management organisations and arrangements.7.The Republic of Slovenia understands that in the application of the provisions of Article 21 (6), (7) and (8), the flag State may rely on the requirements of its legal system under which the prosecuting authorities enjoy a discretion to decide whether or not to prosecute in the light of all the facts of a case. Decisions of the flag State based on such requirements shall not be interpreted as failure to respond or to take action."Confirmation of the declarations made by the European CommunityThe Republic of Slovenia hereby confirms the declarations made by the European Community upon ratification of the Agreement for the implementing of the provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 relating to the conservation and management of straddling fish stocks.”

Declaration:Spain, as a member of the European Community, points out that it has transferred competence to the Community with regard to a number of matters regulated by the Fish Stocks Convention. Spain hereby reaffirms the declarations made by the European Community upon ratifying the Agreement for the Implementation of the Provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 relating to the Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks.See declarations under “European Community”.Interpretative declarations:1.Spain understand that the terms "geographical particularities", "specific characteristics of the subregion or region", "socio-economic, geographical and environmental factors", "natural characteristics of that sea" or any other similar terms employed in reference to a geographical region do not prejudice the rights and duties of States under international law.2.Spain understands that no provision of this Agreement may be interpreted in such a way as to conflict with the principle of freedom of the high seas, recognized by international law.3.Spain understand that the term "States whose nationals fish on the high seas" shall not provide any new grounds for jurisdiction based on the nationality of persons involved in fishing on the high seas rather than on the principle of flag State jurisdiction.4.The Agreement does not grant any State the right to maintain or apply unilateral measures during the transitional period as referred to in article 21, paragraph 3. Thereafter, if no agreement has been reached, States shall act only in accordance with the provisions provided for in articles 21 and 22 of the Agreement.5.Regarding the application ofarticle 21, Spain understands that, when a flag State declares that it intends to exercise its authority, in accordance with the provisions of article 19, over a fishing vessel flying its flag, the auities of the inspecting State shall not purport to exercise any further authority under the provisions of article 21 over such a vessel.Any dispute related to this issue shall be settled in accordance with the procedures provided for in part VIII of the Agreement. No State may invoke this type of dispute to remain in control of a vessel which does not fly its flag.In addition, Spain considers that the word "unlawful" in article 21, paragraph 18 of the Agreement should be interpreted in the light of the whole Agreement, particularly, articles 4 and 35 thereof.6.Spain reiterates that all States shall refrain in their relations from the threat or use of force in accordance with general principles of international law, the United Nations Charter and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.In addition, Spain underlines that the use of force as referred to in article 22 constitutes an exceptional measure which must be based upon the strictest compliance with the principle of proportionality and that any abuse thereof shall imply the international liability of the inspecting State. Any case of non-compliance shall be resolved by peaceful means and in accordance with the applicable dispute-settlement procedures.Furthermore, Spain considers that the relevant terms and conditions for boarding and inspection should be further elaborated in accordance with the relevant principles of international law in the framework of the appropriate regional and subregional fisheries management organizations and arrangements.7.Spain understand that in the application of the provisions of article 21, paragraphs 6, 7 and 8, the flag State may rely on the requirements of its legal system under which the prosecuting authorities enjoy a discretion to decide whether or not to prosecute in the light of all the facts of a case. Decisions of the flag State based on such requirements shall not be interpreted as failure to respond or to take action.8.Spain is of the view that the constituent conventions of regional fisheries management organizations such as the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization, the North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission and the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas, given their status as special international agreements, have legal precedence over the New York Agreement, which sets forth general rules on the conservation and management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks. Part VI of the Agreement, "Compliance and enforcement", laying down boarding and inspection procedures, is therefore to be regarded as a regulation subordinate to alternative mechanisms established by subregional or regional fisheries management organizations which effectively discharge the obligations under the New York Agreement of their members or participants to ensure compliance with the conservation and management measures established by such organizations or arrangements.9.Spain understands that in article 8, paragraph 3, of the Agreement the term "a real interest" used with reference to States which may be members of a regional fisheries management organization shall be regarded as meaning that a regional fisheries management organization must in all circumstances be open to any State whose fleet fishes or has fished in the area covered by the constituent convention of such organization, in respect of which fleet the flag State has the authority to ensure compliance and enforcement. Participation in such organizations by the States in question shall indicate their real interest in the fisheries.

1.The objective of the Agreement, as set out in article 2, is to establish an appropriate legal framework and a comprehensive and effective set of measures for the conservation and management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks.2.The effectiveness of the regime established will depend, inter alia , on whether the conservation and management measures that are applied in areas beyond national jurisdiction take duly into account and are compatible with, those adopted by the relevant coastal States with respect to the same stocks in areas under their national jurisdiction, as provided for in article 7.3.Among the biological characteristics of a fish stock as a factor of which special account must be taken in determining compatible conservation and management measures, in accordance with article 7, paragraph 2(d), Uruguay attaches particular importance to the reproduction period of the fish stock in question, in order to ensure a sound and balanced approach to protection.4.Moreover, in order for the above-mentioned regime to be fully effective, in accordance with the objective and purpose of the Agreement, it is necessary to adopt emergency conservation and management measures, as stated in article 6, paragraph 7, where a serious threat exists to the survival of one or more straddling fish stocks or highly migratory fish stocks as a result of a natural phenomenon or human activity.5.Uruguay is of the view that, if an inspection carried out by a port State on a fishing vessel which is voluntarily present in one of its ports reveals that there are evident grounds for believing that the said fishing vessel has been involved in an activity that is contrary to the sub-regional or regional conservation and management measures on the high seas, then, in exercise of its right and duty to cooperate in conformity with article 23 of the Agreement, the port State should so inform the flag State and request that it take over responsibility for the vessel for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the said measures.

Statement:"It is the belief of the Government of the People's Republic of China that the said Agreement is an important development of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. This Agreement will have a significant impact on the conservation and management of living marine resources, especially fish resources in the high seas as well as on the international cooperation in fishery. Upon signing the Agreement, the Government of the People's Republic of China wish to make the following statement in accordance with article 43 of the Agreement:1.About the understanding of paragraph 7 of article 21 of the Agreement: The Government of China is of the view that the enforcement action taken by the inspecting State with the authorization of the flag State involves state sovereignty and national legislation of the States concerned. The authorized enforcement action should be limited to the mode and scope as specified in the authorization by the flag State. Enforcement action by the inspecting State under such circumstances should only be that of executing the authorization of the flag state.2.About the understanding of subparagraph (f), paragraph 1 of article 22 of the Agreement: This subparagraph provides that the inspecting State shall ensure that its duly authorized inspectors `avoid the use of force except when and to the degree necessary to ensure the safety of the inspectors and where the inspectors are obstructed in the execution of their duties. The degree of force used shall not exceed that reasonably required in the circumstances'. The understanding of the Chinese Government on this provision is that only when the personal safety of the authorized inspectors whose authorization has been duly verified is endangered and their normal inspecting activities are obstructed by violence committed by crew members of fishermen of the fishing vessel under inspection, may the inspectors take appropriate compulsory measures necessary to stop such violence. It should be emphasized that the action of force by the inspectors shall only be taken against those crew members or fishermen committing the violence and must never be taken against the vessel as a whole or other crew members or fishermen."

Part VI of the Agreement, "Compliance and enforcement", laying down boarding and inspection procedures, is therefore to be regarded as a regulation subordinate to alternative mechanisms established by subregional or regional fisheries management organizations which effectively discharge the obligations under the New York Agreement of their members or participants to ensure compliance with the conservation and management measures established by such organizations or arrangements.9.Spain understands that in article 8, paragraph 3, of the Agreement the term "a real interest" used with reference to States which may be members of a regional fisheries management organization shall be regarded as meaning that a regional fisheries management organization must in all circumstances be open to any State whose fleet fishes or has fished in the area covered by the constituent convention of such organization, in respect of which fleet the flag State has the authority to ensure compliance and enforcement. Participation in such organizations by the States in question shall indicate their real interest in the fisheries.

1.The objective of the Agreement, as set out in article 2, is to establish an appropriate legal framework and a comprehensive and effective set of measures for the conservation and management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks.2.The effectiveness of the regime established will depend, inter alia , on whether the conservation and management measures that are applied in areas beyond national jurisdiction take duly into account and are compatible with, those adopted by the relevant coastal States with respect to the same stocks in areas under their national jurisdiction, as provided for in article 7.3.Among the biological characteristics of a fish stock as a factor of which special account must be taken in determining compatible conservation and management measures, in accordance with article 7, paragraph 2(d), Uruguay attaches particular importance to the reproduction period of the fish stock in question, in order to ensure a sound and balanced approach to protection.4.Moreover, in order for the above-mentioned regime to be fully effective, in accordance with the objective and purpose of the Agreement, it is necessary to adopt emergency conservation and management measures, as stated in article 6, paragraph 7, where a serious threat exists to the survival of one or more straddling fish stocks or highly migratory fish stocks as a result of a natural phenomenon or human activity.5.Uruguay is of the view that, if an inspection carried out by a port State on a fishing vessel which is voluntarily present in one of its ports reveals that there are evident grounds for believing that the said fishing vessel has been involved in an activity that is contrary to the sub-regional or regional conservation and management measures on the high seas, then, in exercise of its right and duty to cooperate in conformity with article 23 of the Agreement, the port State should so inform the flag State and request that it take over responsibility for the vessel for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the said measures.
