#Cuba
With respect to article 1, paragraph 1, Cuba considers it pointless and irrelevant to include in the definition of "mercenary" the criterion established in paragraph 1 (b), which requires that material compensation be "substantially in excess of that promised or paid to combatants of similar rank and functions in the armed forces of that party". Cuba is of the view that material compensation alone, whatever the amount, is sufficient for an activity to be considered mercenary.Cuba considers that in order for a natural or legal person to be defined as a mercenary under this Convention, it is not necessary for all the criteria set forth in articles 1 and 2 to be met.The Republic of Cuba will therefore continue to apply the definition set forth in article 119 of its Penal Code of 1988, which defines a mercenary as "anyone who, in order to receive a wage or other form of material compensation, joins a military formation made up, in whole or in part, of individuals who are not citizens of the State in whose territory they plan to act" and "who collaborates in or carries out any other act for the direct or indirect purpose of achieving the aforementioned objective".With respect to article 13, paragraph 1, Cuba considers that it should be clarified that the law referred to in this article applies only to judicial cooperation between States parties, not to criminal proceedings brought against persons presumed to have committed the offence of mercenarism.Pursuant to the provisions of article 17, paragraph 2, Cuba declares that it does not consider itself bound by paragraph 1 of this article.
