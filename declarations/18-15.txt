cuba
The Republic of Cuba declares, pursuant to article 23, paragraph 2, that it does not consider itself bound by the provisions of paragraph 1 of this article with respect to the settlement of disputes arising between States Parties which, in its view, should be resolved through amicable negotiations, and it also declares that it does not recognize the compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice.The Republic of Cuba declares that nothing in article 4, paragraph 2, can be construed as encouraging or condoning the use or threat of use of force in international relations which should, in all circumstances, be strictly governed by the principles of international law and the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.Cuba also holds the view that the relations between States should be based on the provisions of General Assembly resolution 2625 (XXV).Furthermore, State terrorism has historically been a fundamental concern for Cuba, which believes that its total eradication through mutual respect, friendly relations and cooperation among States, and full respect for the principles of sovereignty, territorial integrity, self-determination and non-interference in internal affairs should constitute a priority for the international community.Therefore, Cuba is firmly of the view that the improper use of the armed forces of a State to commit aggression against another State is not countenanced by this Convention, the purpose of which is specifically to combat one of the most deleterious scourges facing the modern world.To condone acts of aggression would effectively mean to condone breaches of international law and the Charter, and to set off conflicts with unpredicatable consequences that would undermine the necessary cohesion of the international community in the fight against the real scourges afflicting the world.Moreover, it is the understanding of the Republic of Cuba that the full extent of the provisions of this Convention will apply to the activities conducted by the armed forces of a state against another in the absence of an armed conflict between the two.Lastly, Cuba wishes to place on record that a United States naval base is located, against the will of the Cuban people and Government, in the province of Guantanamo, a portion of Cuban territory over which the Cuban State does not exercise its rightful jurisdiction because of the unlawful occupation of such portion of its territory by the United States of America. Consequently, the Government of Cuba assumes no responsibility for that portion of its territory for the purposes of the Treaty, since it does not know whether the United States of America has installed, possesses, maintains or intends to install nuclear material, including nuclear weapons, on that portion of unlawfully occupied Cuban territory.
