#Canada
"1. Article 14 (1) (b):Article 14 (1) (b) provides that the obligation of a State Party to exchange financial intelligence shall be ‘within the conditions prescribed by its domestic law.' Given that Canadian law only permits the exchange of information between Financial Intelligence Units through bilateral agreements or arrangements, Canada will provide for exchange of the information referred to in this article only pursuant to such a bilateral agreement or arrangement.2. Article 17:It is the understanding of the Government of Canada that in relation to Article 17 the word ‘diversion' means embezzlement and misappropriation, which constitute the criminal offences of theft and fraud under current Canadian law.3. Article 20:Article 20 provides that the obligation of a State Party to criminalize illicit enrichment shall be ‘subject to its constitution and the fundamental principles of its legal system.' An offence of illicit enrichment is incompatible with the Constitution of Canada, more specifically with the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and the fundamental principles of the Canadian legal system. Canada will therefor not create the offence of illicit enrichment.4. Article 42 (2):Article 42 (2) provides that a State Party ‘may' establish jurisdiction based on nationality. Given that Canada has effective and broad territorial jurisdiction over corruption offences, Canada does not intend to extend its jurisdiction in the case of an offence committed by a Canadian national beyond that existing territorial basis of jurisdiction.5. Article 52:Canada already imposes strict requirements on financial institutions within its jurisdiction to closely scrutinize foreign persons with prominent public functions and theirfamily members and close associates. It is the understanding of the Government of Canada that these current requirements satisfy Article 52, particularly in light of the negotiations of the State Paich led to the creation and inclusion of Article 52 in the Convention. Canada is in the process of undergoing consultations with a view to implementing legislative changes that would broaden this existing due diligence beyond the obligations contained in the Convention and expand the category of persons covered and the financial institutions in whom they apply. Canada will inform the Depository of the outcome of these discussions.6. Article 54:Canada will provide international assistance for the freezing, seizure and forfeiture of proceeds of crime and offence-related property only when the request is accompanied by an order from a court of criminal jurisdiction in the requesting country. In the case where international assistance is required for the forfeiture of this property, Canada will provide assistance only when the request is accompanied by a final order from such a court."

#United States of America
(1)The United States of America reserves the right to assume obligations under the Convention in a manner consistent with its fundamental principles of federalism, pursuant to which both federal and state criminal laws must be considered in relation to the conduct addressed in the Convention. U.S. federal criminal law, which regulates conduct based on its effect on interstate or foreign commerce, or another federal interest, serves as an important component of the legal regime within the United States for combating corruption and is broadly effective for this purpose. Federal criminal law does not apply where such criminal conduct does not so involve interstate or foreign commerce, or another federal interest. There are conceivable situations involving offenses of a purely local character where U.S. federal and state criminal law may not be entirely adequate to satisfy an obligation under the Convention. Similarly, in the U.S. system, the states are responsible for preventive measures governing their own officials. While the states generally regulate their own affairs in a manner consistent with the obligations set forth in the chapter on preventive measures in the Convention, in some cases they may do so in a different manner. Accordingly, there may be situations where state and federal law will not be entirely adequate to satisfy an obligation in Chapters II and III of the Convention. The United States of America therefore reserves to the obligations set forth in the Convention to the extent they (1) address conduct that would fall within this narrow category of highly localized activity or (2) involve preventive measures not covered by federal law governing state and local officials.This reservation does not affect in any respect the ability of the United States to provide international cooperation to other States Parties in accordance with the provisions of the Convention.(2)The United States of America reserves the right not to apply in part the obligation set forth in Article 42, paragraph 1 (b) with respect to the offenses established in accordance with the Convention. The United States does not provide for plenary jurisdiction over offenses that are committed on board ships flying its flag or aircraft registered under its laws. However, in many circumstances, U.S. law provides for jurisdiction over such offenses committed on board U.S. - flagged ships or aircraft registered under U.S. law. Accordingly, the United States shall implement paragraph 1 (b) to the extent provided for under its federal law.(1)In accordance with Article 66, paragraph 3, the United States of America declares that it does not consider itself bound by the obligations set forth in Article 66, paragraph 2.(2)The United States declares that the provisions of the Convention (with the exception of Articles 44 and 46) are non-self-executing. None of the provisions of the Convention creates a private right of action.
