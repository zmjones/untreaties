#Netherlands
"The Kingdom of the Netherlands hereby expresses its intention to ratify the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, subject to the following declarations and such further declarations and reservations as it may deem necessary upon ratification of the Convention.Article 10The Kingdom of the Netherlands acknowledges that unborn human life is worthy of protection. The Kingdom interprets the scope of Article 10 to the effect that such protection - and thereby the term ‘human being' - is a matter for national legislation.Article 15The Netherlands declares that it will interpret the term ‘consent' in Article 15 in conformity with international instruments, such as the Council of Europe Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine and the Additional Protocol concerning Biomedical Research, and with national legislation which is in line with these instruments. This means that, as far as biomedical research is concerned, the term ‘consent' applies to two different situations:1. consent given by a person who is able to consent, and2. in the case of persons who are not able to give their consent, permission given by their representative or an authority or body provided for by law.The Netherlands considers it important that persons who are unable to give their free and informed consent receive specific protection. In addition to the permission referred to under 2. above, other protective measures as included in the above-mentioned international instruments are considered to be part of this protection.Article 23With regard to Article 23 paragraph 1 (b), the Netherlands declares that the best interests of the child shall be paramount.Article 25The individual autonomy of the person is an important principle laid down in Article 3 (a) of the Convention. The Netherlands understands Article 25 (f) in the light of this autonomy. This provision is interpreted to mean that good care involves respecting a persishes with regard to medical treatment, food and fluids."
