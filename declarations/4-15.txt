#Monaco
The Government of His Serene Highness the Prince of Monaco declares that implementation of the Convention must take into account the unique features of the Principality of Monaco, particularly the small size of its territory and the needs of its people.The Government of His Serene Highness the Prince of Monaco considers that articles 23 and 25 of the Convention must not be interpreted as recognizing an individual right to abortion except where expressly provided for under national law.The Government of His Serene Highness the Prince of Monaco considers that the purpose of the Convention is to eliminate all discrimination on the basis of disability and to ensure that persons with disabilities have full enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms on an equal basis with others, but that the Convention does not imply that persons with disabilities should be afforded rights superior to those afforded to persons without disabilities, especially in terms of employment, accommodation and nationality.

#Netherlands
"The Kingdom of the Netherlands hereby expresses its intention to ratify the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, subject to the following declarations and such further declarations and reservations as it may deem necessary upon ratification of the Convention.Article 10The Kingdom of the Netherlands acknowledges that unborn human life is worthy of protection. The Kingdom interprets the scope of Article 10 to the effect that such protection - and thereby the term ‘human being' - is a matter for national legislation.Article 15The Netherlands declares that it will interpret the term ‘consent' in Article 15 in conformity with international instruments, such as the Council of Europe Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine and the Additional Protocol concerning Biomedical Research, and with national legislation which is in line with these instruments. This means that, as far as biomedical research is concerned, the term ‘consent' applies to two different situations:1. consent given by a person who is able to consent, and2. in the case of persons who are not able to give their consent, permission given by their representative or an authority or body provided for by law.The Netherlands considers it important that persons who are unable to give their free and informed consent receive specific protection. In addition to the permission referred to under 2. above, other protective measures as included in the above-mentioned international instruments are considered to be part of this protection.Article 23With regard to Article 23 paragraph 1 (b), the Netherlands declares that the best interests of the child shall be paramount.Article 25The individual autonomy of the person is an important principle laid down in Article 3 (a) of the Convention. The Netherlands understands Article 25 (f) in the light of this autonomy. This provision is interpreted to mean that good care involves respecting a persishes with regard to medical treatment, food and fluids."

#Norway
“Article 12Norway recognises that persons with disabilities enjoy legal capacity on an equal basis with others in all aspects of life. Norway also recognizes its obligations to take appropriate measures to provide access by persons with disabilities to the support they may require in exercising their legal capacity. Furthermore, Norway declares its understanding that the Convention allows for the withdrawal of legal capacity or support in exercising legal capacity, and/or compulsory guardianship, in cases where such measures are necessary, as a last resort and subject to safeguards.Articles 14 and 25Norway recognises that all persons with disabilities enjoy the right to liberty and security of person, and a right to respect for physical and mental integrity on an equal basis with others. Furthermore, Norway declares its understanding that the Convention allows for compulsory care or treatment of persons, including measures to treat mental illnesses, when circumstances render treatment of this kind necessary as a last resort, and the treatment is subject to legal safeguards.”

#Poland
“The Republic of Poland understands that Article 23.1 (b) and Article 25 (a) shall not be interpreted in a way conferring an individual right to abortion or mandating state party to provide access thereto, unless that right is guaranteed by the national law.”“Article 23.1(a) of the Convention refers to the recognition of the right of all persons with disabilities who are of marriageable age to marry and to found a family on the basis of free and full consent of the intending spouses. By virtue of Article 46 of the Convention the Republic of Poland reserves the right not to apply Article 23.1(a) of the Convention until relevant domestic legislation is amended. Until the withdrawal of the reservation a disabled person whose disability results from a mental illness or mental disability and who is of marriageable age, can not get married without the court's approval based on the statement that the health or mental condition of that person does not jeopardize the marriage, nor the health of prospective children and on condition that such a person has not been fully incapacitated. These conditions result from Article 12 § 1 of the Polish Code on Family and Guardianship (Journal of Laws of the Republic of Poland of 1964, No. 9, item 59, with subsequent amendments).”“The Republic of Poland declares that it will interpret Article 12 of the Convention in a way allowing the application of the incapacitation, in the circumstances and in the manner set forth in the domestic law, as a measure indicated in Article 12.4, when a person suffering from a mental illness, mental disability or other mental disorder is unable to control his or her conduct.”"The Republic of Poland understands that Articles 23.1 (b) and 25 (a) shall not be interpreted in a way conferring an individual right to abortion or mandating state party t>StatusSignatories159Parties151TextUnited Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 2515, p. 3;The above Convention was adopted on 13 December 2006 during the sixty-first session of the General Assembly by resolution A/RES/61/106.

When Community rules exist but are not affected, in particular in cases of Community provisions establishing only minimum standards, the Member States have competence, without prejudice to the competence of the European Community to act in this field. Otherwise competence rests with the Member States. A list of relevant acts adopted by the European Community appears in the Appendix hereto. The extent of the European Community's competence ensuing from these acts must be assessed by reference to the precise provisions of each measure, and in particular, the extent to which these provisions establish common rules.3.

Malta further understands that the use of this phrase is intended exclusively to underline the point that where health services are provided, they are provided without discrimination on the basis of disability.Malta’s national legislation considers the termination of pregnancy through induced abortion as illegal.”“… Pursuant to Article 29 (a) (i) and (iii) of the Convention, while the Government of Malta is fully committed to ensure the effective and full participation of persons with disabilities in political and public life, including the exercise of their right to vote by secret ballot in elections and referenda, and to stand for elections, Malta makes the following reservations:With regard to (a) (i):Malta reserves the right to continue to apply its current electoral legislation in so far as voting procedures, facilities and materials are concerned.With regard to (a) (iii):Malta reserves the right to continue to apply its current electoral legislation in so far as assistance in voting procedures is concerned.”"(a) Pursuant to Article 25 of the Convention, Malta makes the following Interpretative Statement - Malta understands that the phrase "sexual and reproductive health" in Art 25 (a) of the Convention does not constitute recognition of any new international law obligation, does not create any abortion rights, and cannot be interpreted to constitute support, endorsement, or promotion of abortion.

The Kingdom interprets the scope of Article 10 to the effect that such protection - and thereby the term ‘human being' - is a matter for national legislation.Article 15The Netherlands declares that it will interpret the term ‘consent' in Article 15 in conformity with international instruments, such as the Council of Europe Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine and the Additional Protocol concerning Biomedical Research, and with national legislation which is in line with these instruments. This means that, as far as biomedical research is concerned, the term ‘consent' applies to two different situations:1. consent given by a person who is able to consent, and2. in the case of persons who are not able to give their consent, permission given by their representative or an authority or body provided for by law.The Netherlands considers it important that persons who are unable to give their free and informed consent receive specific protection. In addition to the permission referred to under 2. above, other protective measures as included in the above-mentioned international instruments are considered to be part of this protection.Article 23With regard to Article 23 paragraph 1 (b), the Netherlands declares that the best interests of the child shall be paramount.Article 25The individual autonomy of the person is an important principle laid down in Article 3 (a) of the Convention. The Netherlands understands Article 25 (f) in the light of this autonomy. This provision is interpreted to mean that good care involves respecting a persishes with regard to medical treatment, food and fluids."“Article 12Norway recognises that persons with disabilities enjoy legal capacity on an equal basis with others in all aspects of life. Norway also recognizes its obligations to take appropriate measures to provide access by persons with disabilities to the support they may require in exercising their legal capacity. Furthermore, Norway declares its understanding that the Convention allows for the withdrawal of legal capacity or support in exercising legal capacity, and/or compulsory guardianship, in cases where such measures are necessary, as a last resort and subject to safeguards.Articles 14 and 25Norway recognises that all persons with disabilities enjoy the right to liberty and security of person, and a right to respect for physical and mental integrity on an equal basis with others. Furthermore, Norway declares its understanding that the Convention allows for compulsory care or treatment of persons, including measures to treat mental illnesses, when circumstances render treatment of this kind necessary as a last resort, and the treatment is subject to legal safeguards.”“The Republic of Poland understands that Article 23.1 (b) and Article 25 (a) shall not be interpreted in a way conferring an individual right to abortion or mandating state party to provide access thereto, unless that right is guaranteed by the national law.”“Article 23.1(a) of the Convention refers to the recognition of the right of all persons with disabilities who are of marriageable age to marry and to found a family on the basis of free and full consent of the intending spouses. By virtue of Article 46 of the Convention the Republic of Poland reserves the right not to apply Article 23.1(a) of the Convention until relevant domestic legislation is amended. Until the withdrawal of the reservation a disabled person whose disability results from a mental illness or mental disability and who is of marriageable age, can not get married without the court's approval based on the statement that the health or mental condition of that person does not jeopardize the marriage, nor the health of prospective children and on condition that such a person has not been fully incapacitated. These conditions result from Article 12 § 1 of the Polish Code on Family and Guardianship (Journal of Laws of the Republic of Poland of 1964, No. 9, item 59, with subsequent amendments).”“The Republic of Poland declares that it will interpret Article 12 of the Convention in a way allowing the application of the incapacitation, in the circumstances and in the manner set forth in the domestic law, as a measure indicated in Article 12.4, when a person suffering from a mental illness, mental disability or other mental disorder is unable to control his or her conduct.”
