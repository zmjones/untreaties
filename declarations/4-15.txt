The French Republic declares that it will interpret the term "consent" in article 15 of the Convention in conformity with international instruments, in particular those that relate to human rights and biomedicine, and with national legislation, which is in line with these instruments. This means that, as far as biomedical research is concerned, the term "consent" applies to two different situations:1. Consent given by a person who is able to consent, and2. In the case of persons who are not able to give their consent, permission given by their representative or an authority or body provided for by law.The French Republic considers it important that persons who are unable to give their free and informed consent receive specific protection, without prejudice to all medical research of benefit to them. In addition to the permission referred to under paragraph 2 above, other protective measures, such as those included in the above-mentioned international instruments, are considered to be part of this protection.With regard to article 29 of the Convention, the exercise of the right to vote is a component of legal capacity that may not be restricted except in the conditions and in accordance with the modalities provided for in article 12 of the Convention.

"The Kingdom of the Netherlands hereby expresses its intention to ratify the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, subject to the following declarations and such further declarations and reservations as it may deem necessary upon ratification of the Convention.Article 10The Kingdom of the Netherlands acknowledges that unborn human life is worthy of protection. The Kingdom interprets the scope of Article 10 to the effect that such protection - and thereby the term ‘human being' - is a matter for national legislation.Article 15The Netherlands declares that it will interpret the term ‘consent' in Article 15 in conformity with international instruments, such as the Council of Europe Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine and the Additional Protocol concerning Biomedical Research, and with national legislation which is in line with these instruments. This means that, as far as biomedical research is concerned, the term ‘consent' applies to two different situations:1. consent given by a person who is able to consent, and2. in the case of persons who are not able to give their consent, permission given by their representative or an authority or body provided for by law.The Netherlands considers it important that persons who are unable to give their free and informed consent receive specific protection. In addition to the permission referred to under 2. above, other protective measures as included in the above-mentioned international instruments are considered to be part of this protection.Article 23With regard to Article 23 paragraph 1 (b), the Netherlands declares that the best interests of the child shall be paramount.Article 25The individual autonomy of the person is an important principle laid down in Article 3 (a) of the Convention. The Netherlands understands Article 25 (f) in the light of this autonomy. This provision is interpreted to mean that good care involves respecting a persishes with regard to medical treatment, food and fluids."

“The Republic of Poland understands that Article 23.1 (b) and Article 25 (a) shall not be interpreted in a way conferring an individual right to abortion or mandating state party to provide access thereto, unless that right is guaranteed by the national law.”“Article 23.1(a) of the Convention refers to the recognition of the right of all persons with disabilities who are of marriageable age to marry and to found a family on the basis of free and full consent of the intending spouses. By virtue of Article 46 of the Convention the Republic of Poland reserves the right not to apply Article 23.1(a) of the Convention until relevant domestic legislation is amended. Until the withdrawal of the reservation a disabled person whose disability results from a mental illness or mental disability and who is of marriageable age, can not get married without the court's approval based on the statement that the health or mental condition of that person does not jeopardize the marriage, nor the health of prospective children and on condition that such a person has not been fully incapacitated. These conditions result from Article 12 § 1 of the Polish Code on Family and Guardianship (Journal of Laws of the Republic of Poland of 1964, No. 9, item 59, with subsequent amendments).”“The Republic of Poland declares that it will interpret Article 12 of the Convention in a way allowing the application of the incapacitation, in the circumstances and in the manner set forth in the domestic law, as a measure indicated in Article 12.4, when a person suffering from a mental illness, mental disability or other mental disorder is unable to control his or her conduct.”"The Republic of Poland understands that Articles 23.1 (b) and 25 (a) shall not be interpreted in a way conferring an individual right to abortion or mandating state party to provide access thereto."
